**Prediction using decision tree algorithm**    
Welcome to the Iris Dataset Prediction project repository! In this project, we have employed the Decision Tree algorithm to predict the species of iris flowers based on various features using the well-known Iris dataset.    

# Project Overview 
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of the Decision Tree algorithm in the field of classification. Decision Trees are powerful and interpretable machine learning models that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In this project, we focus on using a Decision Tree classifier to predict the species of iris flowers based on features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Prepare Your Data
Before you can train a Decision Tree model, you need to prepare your dataset. Make sure your dataset is properly cleaned, preprocessed, and split into features (inputs) and target labels (outputs).

## Import Necessary Libraries
Import the required libraries, including the DecisionTreeClassifier from a machine learning library such as scikit-learn.

## Load and Split Data
Load your dataset and split it into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

## Create and Train the Decision Tree Model
Create an instance of the DecisionTreeClassifier and fit it to your training data.
**Create a Decision Tree classifier**
clf = DecisionTreeClassifier()
**Train the model on the training data**
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Make Predictions
Use the trained model to make predictions on new or unseen data (testing data).
**Predict the labels for the testing data**
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)

## Evaluate Model Performance
Evaluate the performance of the model by comparing its predictions to the actual labels in the testing set. You can use various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
